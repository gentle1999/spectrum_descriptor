    "# The performance of OCR tools for different types of spectrum image\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to illustrate the capability of our designed OCR tool in processing HNMR, CNMR, IR and Mass spectrum images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OCR spectrum image processing script ([Img2Spec](utils/img2spec.py)) has some requirements for the input spectrum image. Figure 1 shows an ideal example. The image needs to have a ppm axis (x-axis) described numerically, and the axis representing the intensity (y-axis) is optional, since the intensity values are normalized to the range of 0-1. The top and right borders are considered illegal in the tool, and if there are extra borders in the original image, users should remove them through image pre-processing. The x-axis needs to have a recognizable axis scale to be bound to its corresponding scale label. For the spectrum line part of the spectrum image, the script scans the entire spectrum line from left to right and takes the height of the first non-empty pixel point identified from top to bottom as the intensity value at this position. Therefore, we want the user-supplied spectrum images to be as clean as possible, where the numeric labels on the axes should be in a clear default font to avoid misidentification of the numbers. If the image has a y-axis, then its label should be vertical text.\n",

The common IR and MS spectrum images are not very different from HNMR and CNMR in format, so our OCR tool can also be used to identify IR and MS spectrum images that meet the above conditions. For some images with recognition errors, users can try to adjust the format of the images (e.g., remove the extra borders) to achieve recognition without involving the data subjects in the images. \n",
